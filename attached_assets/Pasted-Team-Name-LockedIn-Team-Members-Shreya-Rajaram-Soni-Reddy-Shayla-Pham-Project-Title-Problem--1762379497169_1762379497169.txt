Project Title
Problem: What problem are we trying to solve?
Many students struggle to prioritize which tasks to complete first, resulting
in missed deadlines, rushed submissions, and stress. Our goal is to
create an Assignment Optimizer that will propose the ideal order for
completing tasks to reduce lateness and workload pressure.
Motivation: Why is this a problem?
College students frequently struggle to manage overlapping deadlines
and underestimate how long assignments will take. Without a data-driven
strategy, they frequently assume priorities, causing additional stress and
poor results. A scheduling assistant that employs algorithms to determine
the optimal task order of completion can resolve this.
Features: When do we know that we have solved the problem? [0.25 point]
We can solve this problem by predicting the task duration from complexity
and type to simulate real workloads of a dataset of 100,000+ tasks. To
schedule tasks, we will use the Earliest Deadline First and Shortest Job
First algorithms. We will assess the lateness and total completion times of
both methods. We will generate a day-by-day schedule outlining which
things to complete and when.
Data: (Public data set we will be using and the link to the public data set) or (Schema of
randomly generated data - i.e. what are the different columns in our dataset and the
respective datatypes)
The dataset will be synthetically generated to simulate student assignments.
It will contain 100,000 or more tasks to meet project requirements.
Each entry represents one assignment with the following fields:
a. assignment_id (int): Unique identifier for each task
b. assignment_name (string): Randomly generated name (e.g., “Project 3” or
“Essay Draft”)
c. due_date (float): Number of hours or days until the deadline
d. longevity (float): Estimated duration or time needed to complete the task (in
hours)
e. complexity (int): Difficulty level from 1–5 (used to estimate longevity)
f. priority (int): Optional manual importance rating (1–5)
Tools: Programming languages or any tools/frameworks we will be using [0.25 point] :
Language: C++
Libraries: vector, algorithm, chrono, fstream
Optional: Python + Matplotlib for runtime charts
Environment: VS Code or CLion
Visuals: Wireframes

Strategy: Preliminary algorithms or data structures you may want to implement and how
would you represent the data [0.25 points]
Implement two non-trivial schedulers using manual heaps.
● Earliest Deadline First (EDF): Min-Heap keyed by deadline to minimize lateness.
● Shortest Job First (SJF): Min-Heap keyed by duration to maximize throughput.
Represent each assignment as a Task struct with duration and deadline.
Use array-based heap operations (insert, extractMin, heapify).
Accumulate durations until 24 hours to auto-assign daily time blocks.
